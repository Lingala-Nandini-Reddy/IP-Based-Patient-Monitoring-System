# IP-Based-Patient-Monitoring-System
This project is an IP-Based Patient Monitoring System designed to track and monitor patients' vital signs remotely through an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It allows healthcare providers to monitor critical patient data in real-time, helping to ensure timely medical response and improve patient care.

**In this project, sensors are used to collect essential health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. The data is then transmitted over an IP network to a central monitoring system, where it is visualized and stored for further analysis.**

**The system is ideal for applications in remote or home-based patient monitoring, providing continuous access to patient health information without requiring direct physical presence.**

### **Key Features**
**Real-Time Monitoring: Monitors vital signs continuously and provides instant access to health data.**
**Remote Access: Health data is accessible over an IP network, enabling remote monitoring.**
**Data Visualization: Displays critical health parameters in an easy-to-read format for quick assessment.**
**Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts to healthcare providers if any metric crosses a threshold, ensuring timely medical intervention.**

### **Use Cases**
**Remote patient monitoring in home healthcare settings**
**Post-operative monitoring for patients in recovery**
**Continuous monitoring in hospital wards**
### **Future Enhancements**
**AI and Machine Learning Integration: Analyze historical data to predict potential health risks.**
**Mobile Application: Provide access to real-time data on mobile devices for convenience.**
